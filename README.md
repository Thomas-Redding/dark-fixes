# dark-fixes

Chrome comes with a flag that enables experimental code which attempts to render all websites using a dark themes. You can activate this flag by

1. Navigating to [chrome://flags/](chrome://flags/).
2. Enabling `Force Dark Mode for Web Contents`.
3. Restarting Chrome.

This experiment is pretty good, but messes up some things. This extension is just me fixing some of those errors.
